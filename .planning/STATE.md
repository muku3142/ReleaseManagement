# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-27)

**Core value:** Given a set of Jira tickets, produce accurate and consistent release documentation plus a tracked deployment record — without anyone doing manual release bookkeeping in Jira.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — release-assembly

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: Not started
human-action checkpoint needing a live Jira API token to capture CNV-2896's
dev-status response. Waves 1-5 are complete: 02-01, 02-02, 02-03, 02-05,
02-06, 02-07. The user confirmed the /tickets screen works against the real
tenant (projects, sprints, search, table) and elected to move to Phase 3 with
02-04 outstanding.

**Phase 2 is NOT formally complete.** Outstanding before it can be closed:

- 02-04 dev-status capture (needs a human with a live token). Phase 6 cannot be
  scoped until this resolves — that dependency is unchanged.

- JIRA-02..07 are still `Pending` in REQUIREMENTS.md. Deliberately not ticked:
  JIRA-03 (paging to exhaustion) is proven by WireMock only, never against a
  >100-ticket real result set, and the evidence-notes discipline from Phase 1
  says not to tick on a passing suite alone.

Post-plan changes landed after their plans were marked complete (all recorded in
the relevant summaries): JIRA-07 status filter, fix version made optional then
replaced entirely by **sprint** (brings Jira's Agile API into scope, reversing
part of a PROJECT.md exclusion), the system-field-wins fix for shadowed field
names, table widening, and frontend tests moved to `frontend/tests/`.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Jira→ADO link-discovery spike placed in Phase 2 (Jira), not Phase 6 (ADO) — Phase 6 cannot be scoped in detail until it resolves
- Roadmap: ADO enrichment sequenced after document generation (Phase 6 after Phase 5) so documents work Jira-only first, per the "must never gate" constraint
- Roadmap: AUTH folded into Phase 1 (Foundation) rather than given its own phase — reuses Jira credentials, no separate user store
- Roadmap: Template engine design (jmustache + view-model + placeholder catalog) is the first work inside Phase 4, settled before the authoring UI is built on top of it
- [Phase 01]: Testcontainers 2.x renamed postgresql/junit-jupiter modules to testcontainers-postgresql/testcontainers-junit-jupiter — Plan's pre-2.x artifact IDs no longer exist on Maven Central
- [Phase 01]: Spring Boot 4.1 moved Flyway autoconfiguration into spring-boot-starter-flyway and @WebMvcTest into spring-boot-starter-webmvc-test — Raw flyway-core and spring-boot-starter-test no longer autoconfigure these on their own in Boot 4.1's modularized autoconfigure
- [Phase 01]: Explicitly restored CsrfFilter.DEFAULT_CSRF_MATCHER on top of csrf.spa() - oauth2ResourceServer() unconditionally exempts bearer-resolvable (cookie-carried) requests from CSRF, mitigated in practice by access_token's SameSite=Strict
- [Phase 01]: Jackson 3 (tools.jackson.*) is Boot 4.1's managed Jackson databind - com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper no longer resolves, only jackson-annotations stays under com.fasterxml
- [Phase 01]: Narrowed ArchitectureBoundaryTest's application-vs-adapters ban to jira/persistence/web only — AuthenticationService must inject JwtTokenService (adapters.security) directly - no port abstraction exists over session/JWT infrastructure, and none is warranted for a single-implementation technical concern
- [Phase 01]: JiraAccessContextService.currentContext() is the sole AUTH-02 mechanism for the rest of the project — Keyed strictly on CurrentUserPort.currentAccountId(); no overload takes an accountId and no shared-credential path exists anywhere in the codebase
- [Phase 01]: AuthController extracts a shared accountId(jwt) helper so jwt.getSubject() is called from exactly one place — Keeps the literal grep-gated acceptance criterion accurate while removing duplication between session() and replaceCredential()
- [Phase 01]: PUT /api/auth/credential revalidates the replacement token live against Jira using the stored email before upserting, and rejects ACCOUNT_MISMATCH (409) if the validated identity belongs to a different account — AUTH-04 requires replace-without-losing-data; revalidation prevents storing a token Jira itself would reject, and the mismatch check prevents one account's credential row being overwritten by another account's token
- [Phase 01]: Frontend credentialStatus.ts uses a dependency-free useSyncExternalStore module instead of a state library for the single credential-invalid boolean signal — Avoids adding a state-management dependency for one boolean flag shared between apiFetch and CredentialAlert

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2's Jira→ADO link-discovery spike outcome will determine Phase 6's exact scope (dev-status mechanism vs. commit/PR key-parsing fallback, or both) — revisit Phase 6 plan-phase once the spike lands.
